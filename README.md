# **Feature-rich AutoHotkey hub. Make everyday tasks effortless.**

>Developed since 2010.

>GUI is a little outdated and messy, but I keep the functionality working.

## Introduction

The main goals of this project are:
- **All in one hub.** Create a hub for everything a user would want to customize or extend on Windows.
- **Improve productivity.** Adds tools that allow you to improve your productivity.
- **User experience.** Easy to use GUI with plenty of hints. 
- **Highly Configurable.** Every feature can be disabled or enabled as per your needs.

 - Right clicking on items to edit the url and name. Supports urls/files/folders/network locations.
 - The shortcuts are also linked to hotkeys such as (F4 + 1,2,3...8). In this example, if you press F4 + 2 it will open gmail. (**F4** is configurable)

- **Hub for all your scripts.** Add your own scripts which can be controlled from within the program(edit/delete/stop). All of them auto start with windows and are stopped when you exit the program. Suspend, Pause and Reload commands for the main program are propagated to all your scripts so all of them are in the same state.
- Includes an optional extension framework that adds some helper functions.
- **Sync.** Extensions can be setup to sync to a git repository.
- **Some built-in extensions.** Includes some useful hotkeys like: minimize current window by double-tapping ALT, clicking the middle button in the file explorer navigates up one folder level etc.

## Taskbar functions

- **Volume Control**. Scrolling over the taskbar will adjust your volume.
