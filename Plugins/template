AutoHotkey is a very intuitive language once you get the hang of it!
Use the documentation from the links below. There are a lot of examples provided for basic things.


Here are some pages that might help get you started:

https://autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm
https://autohotkey.com/docs/Hotstrings.htm
https://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/index.htm
https://autohotkey.com/docs/misc/WinTitle.htm

Try to keep the Plugin.Properties line at the beginning of the script. Everything else you can change!

Head over to the Libraries folder within the installation folder(My Documents) to see what is available to you.
I've included the Functions.lib file which consists of many integrating functions.

You will find functions like RSNotify(text), which is basically notifications at the bottom of your screen.

- Hotkey creation example -
Let's register F7 as a hotkey that sets the active window to be always on top. 
If that window is already set to stay on top, we will toggle it off.

F7::
    WinSet, AlwaysOnTop, Toggle, A
    WinGet, ExStyle, ExStyle, A
    if !(ExStyle & 0x8)
        RSNotify("AlwaysOnTop: Off")
    else
        RSNotify("AlwaysOnTop: On")
return

Always reload the main program in order to start the plugins correctly.
